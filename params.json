To support some specific android device, you need to add the VID,\r\nadd udev rule, etc.\r\nIf you want to support your devices natively of adb, you should change the\r\nusb_vendors.c code, then build the whole android source to get the adb tool.\r\nIt cause too much to gain the benefit.\r\n\r\nThis project is to build the adb source standalone out of the Android build\r\nscript system. I merged the main adb source with some essential libraries\r\n(libcutils and libzipfile), and add Makefile for it.\r\n\r\n* This project has supported fastboot (from 0.1.0).\r\n\r\n===\r\nINSTRUCTIONS:\r\n\r\n1. After get the source, you can change the usb_vendor_ids.c to add your VID.\r\n    use debian/gen_udev_rules.sh to generate udev rule for those VID.\r\n\r\n2. make\r\n    build the adb and fastboot\r\n\r\n3. make install\r\n    install the adb and fastboot into /usr/bin/ configure the udev\r\n\r\n4. copy 51-android.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d/\r\n\r\n===\r\nTO BUILD .DEB PACKAGE\r\n\r\n1. Check dpkg tools (dpkg-dev, dh-make, debhelper, fakeroot, etc.)\r\n\r\n2. run `dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -b` to generate .deb package\r\n    (To install the package, you could use `sudo dpkg -i ../adb_x.x.x-1.xxx.deb`)\r\n\r\n===\r\nOR DOWNLOAD the prebuilt package\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/downloads/karfield/adb/adb_0.1.0-1_amd64.deb\r\n\r\ninstall the deb by graphic installer or command(`sudo dpkg -i xxx.deb`)\r\n\r\nFor Mac\r\n===\r\n\r\nHowto compile?\r\ngit clone this repo. run\r\n ./autogen.sh\r\n make install\r\n\r\nto support homebrew use\r\n 1. brew create https://github.com/downloads/karfield/adb/adb-mac-1.0.1.tgz\r\n\r\nGive a name: Adb4Mac\r\n\r\n 2. brew edit Adb4Mac\r\n\r\nModify like this:\r\n    require 'formula'\r\n\r\n    class Adb4Mac < Formula\r\n        homepage 'https://git.hub/karfield/adb/'\r\n        url 'https://github.com/downloads/karfield/adb/adb-1.0.1.tgz'\r\n        md5 '308a5476fc096a8a525d07279a6f6aa3' ## dont mod this line, it's auto-gen\r\n        \r\n        def install\r\n           system \"./autogen.sh\"\r\n           system \"./configure\", \"--prefix=#{prefix}\"\r\n           system 'make install'\r\n        end\r\n    end\r\n\r\n 3. brew install Adb4Mac\r\n\r\nif you don't compile this on your mac, just download the excutable bin files,\r\n   copy them (adb and fastboot) into wherever you wannt.\r\n   OR run install-adb-for-mac.sh(download https://github.com/downloads/karfield/adb/install-adb-for-mac.tar.gz)\r\n\r\nEnjoy it!\r\n","tagline":"adb standalone","name":"Adb (standalone)","google":""}
